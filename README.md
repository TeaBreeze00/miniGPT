# miniGPT
This project implements a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) for text generation using PyTorch. The model learns to predict the next character in a sequence, enabling the generation of coherent text based on a given input prompt. The dataset used for training consists of tokenized text, and the system employs an LSTM-based architecture for sequence modeling.
